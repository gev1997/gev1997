Hi, I'm a Software Engineer passionate about designing and building high-performance software systems.
ðŸ”§ I specialize in system architecture, low-level optimization, and crafting scalable, maintainable solutions across a variety of platforms.
ðŸš€ Whether it's squeezing every bit of performance out of C++ or architecting robust backend infrastructures, I'm driven by clean design and measurable impact.
ðŸ“ˆ I believe in writing code that not only works, but lasts.
